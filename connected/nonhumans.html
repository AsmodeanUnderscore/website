			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">Replica are synthetic individuals designed to imitate the appearance of the other races.

			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">Replica are manufactured for the purpose of being sold to non-Replica citizens to serve as workers, caretakers, and even soldiers when sold to other nations. When a citizen of Redland purchases a Replica, they also purchase a Contract, which can be bought by and transferred to other citizens via the legal system with the owner's consent. These Contracts are taxed by ConnectiCorp; failure to pay this tax will result in the Replica being claimed by ConnectiCorp and being either sold or drafted into the army.</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">Replica are, by default, connected to the <a href="network.html">Network</a>, which functions both as their power source and also the place from which they derive their sapience. They are Linked to the local <a href="network.html#Emitter">Emitter</a>. Most Replica will power off if they attempt to travel too far from the reach of their designated Emitter's signal, unless their connection is manually transferred to another one, however there are certain Replica built without this limitation, as their line of work may involve a large amount of travel or similar.</td></tr>

Standing up to seven feet tall, they are the second tallest race next to the Utval. They have gills that allow them to breathe underwater, although they are also capable of breathing on land. They have created several vast underseas empires and kingdoms, ruling the world's waters as the only race native to them. They are known for having a tendency to swallow their food whole, having evolved detachable jaws.</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">Over the last two centuries since the reactivation of the <a href="network.html">Network</a>, a good portion of the population has moved to the surface, as Emitters cannot function underwater. Since arriving, many Sathe have come to have an obsession with technology, including cybernetic modifications. It is estimated that just under half of the Sathe population lives on land.</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">Since their original campaigns of conquest against the surface in the first few years after the reactivation of the Network, a number of different Sathe nations have been founded on the surface. Although they have a hand in international trade, diplomatic relations with these nations are often minimal, as many still hold grudges against them and say that the Sathes' land should still belong to its original owners.</td></tr>

Like all other plant and animal life on Zahgis, the Utval have evolved to metabolise the extremely high concentrations of sulphurous, chlorinous and ammonia gases that collect in the area, as opposed to being poisoned by them. They are the tallest race in the world, standing up to ten feet tall.</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">After the <a href="network.html">Network</a> was reactivated, the Utval left their homeland for the first time, using bulky environmental suits to breathe in the lands of other races. Prior to first contact, Zahgis had been assumed to be an uninhabited wasteland, due to its local atmosphere. The Utvals' suits add a special mixture of gases similar to the air of their homelands to the air in their lungs, allowing them to breathe. Their suits, along with their tall and bulky physiques, often make them sem intimidating to the other races.</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan=3 style="text-align:justify;">In the year 185, for unknown reasons, all of the active <a href="network.html#Emitter">Emitters</a> in Zahgis malfunctioned and exploded, all in the space of a few hours. This devastated the existing Utval nations, and the mixture of carcinogens released caused disfiguring mutations in many of the Utval and the native wildlife of Zahgis. Since then, a great number of Utval have moved to other continents, taking an intense interest in studying the Network to determine the reasons behind the incident. Many Utval have come to believe that their kind are the descendants of the ancient race that created the network, although these claims are currently unverified.</td></tr>
