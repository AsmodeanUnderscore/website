			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Appearance</td><td style="width:400px;">Flahne is a slim blonde with a "rebellious side" styled haircut; undercut/trim on a side with medium length hair that goes accross, curving down to her chin.

A orange skinny tie (half windsor) with a silver tie bar along with a "Orange Security" Insignia pin on her left top lapel.

			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Personality</td><td style="width:400px;">Flahne does it for work, she doesn't do it as a job. Flahne is the type of person who just wants something to do. At the workplace, she is a stern, conservative, punctual, and mannered. She tends to be the one winning the grip strength contest in handshakes. She has a strong poker face and is a natural at observation. However, from all this, she has a soft side. Who said she couldn't have fun? In reality, she is a flirt who tries alittle bit too hard in the end. Like other correspondants, she is a good social worker and one of the supervisors of Human Resources.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Skills</td><td style="width:400px;">Flanhe sports slightly above average endurace compared to the average female. She is a quick sprinter and even quicker to the draw. She is well trained in the art of debate and reason and is very well informed. She is a decent fighter, but an amazing writer. She also is experienced in software and hacking, along with going undercover. Her ability best suits a scout.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Biography</td><td style="width:400px;">Flahne first started as an independant contractor in research and political informant. Eventually, after being scouted by Orange Security, she was enrolled in the security program and sent to human resources. She was tasked with convincing clients to make more contracts with Orange Security, as well as cutting off loose ends. She enjoys the rank of First Lieutenant in Security and donns the Supervisor role in the office. Her background is clean and her family records were moderate. She grew up with good parents and good influences, but she was infuriated by politics and the media. Enough to the point to delve into research and switch her stance on life, paving her own path of morals and destiny.</td></tr>
