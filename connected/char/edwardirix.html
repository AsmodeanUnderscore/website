			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Appearance</td><td style="width:400px;">Edward stands at a height of 5’9”. His complexion is a light brown and his glowing blue eyes contrast with his complexion. His hair is styled into a mohawk and it is colored with a luminescent neon blue. He enjoys wearing a dark leather jacket and he wears dark gloves with blunt metal studs which line his fingers.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Personality</td><td style="width:400px;">Edward is a risk taker and a smooth talker. He does whatever he can to make a few credits. Whether it be through lies and manipulation or murder and violence, Edward will resort to anything to get his way. In spite of this, Edward keeps his friends and contacts close, but if he deems them to be dead weight, then he will have no qualms about ending their ‘friendship’. He hates being pitied or looked down upon in general.  All in all, Edward is selfishly focused upon himself and no one else.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Skills</td><td style="width:400px;">Edward is a middle man and a popular fence. He keeps a very large list of contacts and for the right price, he can get his hands on just about anything. His aim and knowledge of guns is mediocre at best, but good enough to keep himself alive. He knows the Hack City streets like the back of his hand and he’s very familiar with the gangs and factions.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Biography</td><td style="width:400px;">Edward was born in High Tower territory, but he and his parents mostly roamed around the Slum Kings and Black Mask territories. His mother was a paid prostitute and his dad was a simple gun for hire. Edward was forced to care for himself while his parents spent every single credit on drugs. For the most part, they were homeless while they spent their nights sleeping within the filth filled alleys and gutters. When he was nine, he simply left and had lost all emotional attachments to his parents, but thanks to his parents constant roaming, Edward was inherently familiar with the streets of Hack City. Despite his knowledge of the streets, he had little knowledge on the factions and the dramas between them. He was eventually found and caught by the High Towers and his knowledge of the streets was put to use while he was forced to deal out drugs. In return, the High Towers provided a shabby roof and daily bits of food. Edward considered this to be more of a blessing rather than suffering as it provided a much better life than his previous. Overtime, he was entrusted with more drugs to sell, a gun, and better living conditions. At the age of fifteen, Edward made a few friends with low level Black Masks while keeping his High Tower relationship a secret. He more or less befriended and manipulated people until he could sell Black Mask drugs for a percentage of the profits. Edward continued to make ‘friends’ and contacts while he gained a knack at slithering himself between large deals and becoming the middle man. He has left the drug trade to actively become a fence, but his leave has made him the center of drama between High Towers and Black Masks. Now, he is hunkering down while hoping for the drama to cool and pass.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold; text-aligh:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Inventory</td><td style="width:400px;">His inventory varies on a day to day basis, but normally, he has a metal studded bat strapped behind his back and a revolver hidden in his jacket. He keeps his Connector in a zipper pocket.</td></tr>
