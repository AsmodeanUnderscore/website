			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Appearance</td><td style="width:400px;">Pierce would be at an average male height of 6'. His face haves the vague touch of some asian descent. He would donn a fair pair of black eyebrows, under them, dark brown eyes. He has stiff but untainted hair; it is styled into a crewcut with a fade on the sides. Typically, he is seen wearing light silver framed orange tinted sun glasses which function as his perscription glasses. He has a slim but athletic build for someone of his stature and retains a semi confident posture. During work, he would donn a microfiber resistant vest disguised as a dress vest. Followed up with a solid satin orange tie with a half windsor knot along with a clean tucked gray dress shirt. He is typically seen with a medium sized holster on his right hip and extra ammunition on his left. However, this is only concealment protection at best. Something about his smile gives the hint of immaturity.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Personality</td><td style="width:400px;">Pierce enjoys socializing and meeting new people. At work, on the streets, at the bar. Most of them he meets are shady thugs of course. Pierce is a random self reserved weirdo as described by his co workers. Or in short, a dork. He enjoys a light hearted life  though he is at risk to die anyday. He tends to be laid back, even with the higher ups of companies. Making him appear more open and liked by the people he is contracted to. But,when shit hits the fan, Pierce throws the lax life away and goes into action. Being human, he admits he is afraid, but already has made good with the thought of dying. His sense of morals is strong, but abandons them in the line of work. He has a strong resolve but is also naturally a klutz which washes over this feature. Additionally, although unexplicable, he is unable to talk to women without being nervous. </td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Skills</td><td style="width:400px;">Pierce is a average man working in his field, but what makes him stand out is his recklessness and will to pull the craziest of plans. He has great social skills and is quick to draw his weapon. He is also a natural actor, feigning personalities and backstories to new people he meets in his line if work out of suspicsion.</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right; vertical-align:top; padding:0 9px; width:64px;">Biography</td><td style="width:400px;">Pierce got his Private Armed Security License at an academy dedicated to train future officers. He was also trained in higher level weaponry, allowing him to bring a rifle spec weapon into his line of work. Although he didnt follow the path of working at HCPD, he found a better place at a private mercenary group "Orange Security" looking to hire lower foot soldiers as  body guards. Though required to follow the "law", when the need arises, he is required to identify as a mercenary from another company to cover Orange Security's tracks and deals. He is considered a rookie in his job although he has already been in the company for two years as a guard for high ranking officials, drug dealers and Orange Security officers. For some reason, his wage is increased for some reason. He is usually accompanied with a Lieutenant and a few other low ranking grunts. He doesn't consider himself to be the best, but he enjoys the adrenaline being a private security officer provides.</td></tr>
